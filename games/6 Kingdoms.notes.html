The land of 6 Kingdoms is ripe for the taking!  Armies of elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, and dragons await your commands! Will you try to conquer the land as a 
member of the Ironforge Pact using either the mysterious Dragonfire Coast Federation, the swashbuckling Pirates of Razor Pass, or the barbaric Uthgardian Empire?
Or will you choose to fight on the side of the Falconfall Alliance as the noble Gandar Republic, the diverse League of Kahnbrek, or the expansionistic Burusian Empire?
Whatever way you choose, the fight will be tough!
